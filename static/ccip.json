How's it different from Civic Hacking or Gov Tech? As an emerging field, local and international meetups/confs are organized, definitions are proposed, actions and ideas spread. This talk focuses on a few civic tech-related conferences: CfA summit, OGP summit, TICTeC, PDF. I will analyze their \"civic tech personalities\" to show different approaches in this field . Standing from Taiwan's viewpoint with experiences of travelling around global civic tech conferences, I want to ask what others can learn from Taiwan and whatTaiwan can learn from others."},"speakers":[{"id":"recrU2XQBoXoMYgmO","COUNTRY":"Taiwan","COUNTRY_CODE":["tw"],"avatar":"https://dl.airtable.com/0sKMDQfTDmqpoU2mUj8A_full_50.jpg","zh":{"name":"李梅君","bio":"潛伏在台灣零時政府裡，挖掘故事與八卦，思考公民怎麼與科技連結的人類學家。研究關懷黑客行動主義、開放運動、數位民主等議題。2016-2017 間，曾在開放文化基金會打雜，協助舉辦 Civic Tech Fest，並與曾柏瑜共同撰寫《開放政府觀察報告 2014-2016》。現旅居美國加州不靠海的沙漠裡，搔頭苦惱博士論文怎麼下筆。"},"en":{"name":"Mg Lee","bio":"MG is a participant observer of g0v.

These phenomena are more preponderate in Sub-Saharan Africa where weak institutions cannot implement the required checks and balances necessary for effective democratic and accountable governance. As such, Connected Development through its initiative, Follow The Money (FTM), since 2012, has been at the frontline of technology driven initiatives that seek to address these aforementioned governance challenges in Nigeria (and now in other African countries). The initiative tracks government spending in rural communities for open government, service delivery and poverty reduction. More interesting is the use of technology in the operations of FTM. The initiative launched ifollowthemoney.org platform to broaden impact, decentralize its operations, mobilize citizens to follow the money themselves and exchange knowledge on FTM activities. This open source platform has recorded mass followership in just a year, with an estimate of 1400 journalists, community champions, activists, and data enthusiasts etc. In addition, the initiative has used other technology tools such as radio through FTM radio series, social media, mobile phones etc. in the course of its work. \n\nThis research is a critical examination of the operations and methodologies of Follow The Money, outstandingly the role and impact of technology in its strategy. It investigates how these technologies have inspired citizens to perform virtual and real time public oversight and have facilitated public spending data access/exchange. As such, the research tries to answer the following questions: 1). How has Follow The Money evolved and what specific methodologies and approaches does it use in mobilizing communities to hold their governments to account?, 2). In what ways has Follow The Money used technology in the course of its work, what are the outcomes of such and what limitations have such tools encountered?, 3). What are the challenges being faced by the initiative and what lessons has it learnt?"},"speakers":[{"id":"rec0TKRSNGB54Un4A","COUNTRY":"Nigeria","COUNTRY_CODE":["ng"],"avatar":"https://dl.airtable.com/aikSK9ImRIsgoREL3AzQ_full_20.jpg","zh":{"name":"Chambers Umezulike","bio":"I am a Development Expert, Civil Society Practitioner and Academic Researcher.
